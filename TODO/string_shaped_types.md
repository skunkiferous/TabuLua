# Shaped string types — a string that is validated (and canonicalized) as a table

## Status

**Phases 1, 3 & 4 landed (2026-07-14). Phase 2 (the read-back sandbox helper) is the
only one open.** Gate green: 3233 tests, 38/38 bad-input fixtures.

Phase 1 flushed out three prerequisite bugs (below). Phase 3 — the round-trip proof —
flushed out a fourth, smaller one and confirmed the core claim held:

- **The claim survived.** A `{Coord:string}` map round-trips through **every** format:
  native TSV (ltcn reads `["1,2"]=v` straight back), typed JSON, natural JSON, XML and
  SQL, plus the full `manifest_loader` → `reformatter` → reload cycle, which also
  canonicalizes a non-canonical `["1, 2"]` to `["1,2"]` in the file and is stable on a
  second pass. All because a shaped key is only ever a **string** to the serializers.
  Covered in `spec/shaped_types_round_trip_spec.lua`.
- **Bug 4 (fixed): shaped types were not idempotent on re-registration.** Every other
  custom-type kind tolerates an identical re-declaration (expression types via
  `EXPR_VALIDATORS`, string/number types via their generated-name cache, aliases
  directly), but `restrictWithShape` registered the user name straight through
  `extendParser`, which rejects a reused name. So loading a package that declares a
  shaped type *twice in one process* (load, then reload — exactly what a round-trip test
  does) failed on the second pass. Fixed with a `SHAPE_TYPES` registry mirroring
  `EXPR_VALIDATORS`: identical re-registration is a no-op, a conflicting one is a clear
  error. (Added to `MUTABLE_TABLES`, so the global-reset snapshot covers it.)
- **A natural-JSON limitation, documented not fixed.** Natural JSON has no key type, so
  a foreign reader coerces a numeric-looking object key back to a number. A `Coord` key
  (`"1,2"`) is never numeric-looking, so it survives; but a *single-scalar* shape whose
  canonical form is a bare number (e.g. `{integer}` → `"5"`) would be read back as `5`
  by a naive consumer. TabuLua's own type-directed reimport keeps it exact (it knows the
  key is a `Coord`); this is the same known natural-JSON key issue as
  `json_complex_values.md`, not a shaped-types bug.

### The three prerequisite bugs Phase 1 flushed out

The feature itself went in as designed — `shape` field, `restrictWithShape`,
canonicalization, one new dispatch branch, no grammar change. What it *cost* was
three pre-existing bugs, none of them obvious until a shaped type leaned on them:

1. **No user-defined type could be a map key** (`NEVER_TABLE` was never set for
   derived types, so `{Code:integer}` was refused with "map key_type can never be a
   table" — about a *string*). A hard prerequisite: a shaped type that cannot key a
   map is pointless. Fixed by inheriting the flag in `doTypeParamsUpdate`.
2. **A tuple cell with too many elements crashed the load** (`fields_parsers[i]`
   indexed past the end → `parser is nil` inside `callParser`). Fixed to report the
   bad cell. The *missing*-element half of that hole (a `{integer,integer}` happily
   accepts `1`) was left alone by decision — see Decisions below.
3. **A `pattern`-only custom string type could not be registered at all**
   (`restrictString` asked `rangeToIdentifier` to name a range that wasn't there, and
   failed with "min and max cannot both be nil" about numbers nobody wrote).

And one design decision the tests forced, rather than the plan:

- **A key collision is an error, not a last-wins.** The first draft let two spellings
   of a key collapse silently. The spec caught that `pairs()` decides *which* value
   survives — so the same file could load differently between runs. The map parser now
   rejects a duplicate key, as the record parser already did for a duplicate field.
   This is the one shared-container change; it fires only when two *distinct* raw keys
   parse to the same key, which no existing data does (the gate is green).

## Summary

A **shaped string type** is a custom type whose values are **strings at runtime**, but
whose text must parse as a given **table type**. Declared entirely in data:

```
name:name	parent:type_spec|nil	shape:type_spec|nil
Coord	string	{integer,integer}
Rect	string	{x:integer,y:integer,w:integer,h:integer}
```

A `Coord` cell holds `1,2`. It is a string — so it sorts, exports, and (the point)
**works as a map key**: `{ Coord : Item }` is a legal column type, and the native cell
`["1,2"]=Sword` is something every reader in the pipeline can already read back.

This is the practical answer to [tables_as_keys.md](tables_as_keys.md). That doc's
Option B was "canonical-string key encoding", costed as *medium-high, touches the type
core, and doesn't fix natural JSON". Confining the same idea to a **declared type**
instead of retrofitting it onto every table changes the economics completely: the type
core, `ltcn`, the JSON layouts, the XML form, the SQL export and the four serializers
all need **zero** changes, because a shaped value is only ever a string to them.

**No type-spec grammar change.** The shape is a `type_spec` in a *cell*, which
`custom_type_def` already does for its `parent` field. It never appears in a column
header, so the header grammar is untouched.

## Why canonicalization is the whole trick

The shape parser hands back a *reformatted* canonical text alongside the parsed table.
We store **that** as the value, not what the author typed. So `1, 2` and `1,2` both
become the string `1,2`.

Which lands exactly on reason 3 of tables_as_keys — the one that doc called a
language-level constraint we cannot fix:

> Lua compares table keys by **identity (reference)**, not by **structure**. […]
> content-addressed table keys are semantically meaningless in stock Lua without a
> custom equality layer.

Lua compares *strings* by value, and interns them. Two structurally-equal canonical
keys **are the same key**, in stock Lua, with no interning layer of ours. The
canonicalization step is what turns "a string that looks like a table" into a genuine
value-semantics key; without it, `1, 2` and `1,2` would be two different map entries
that look identical to a reader.

Corollary: canonicalization is **not optional** in this design. (Decided 2026-07-14.)

## Design

### The field

One new `custom_type_def` field, `shape:type_spec|nil`
([parsers/builtin.lua](../parsers/builtin.lua), the `custom_type_def` alias), and one
new branch in [`registerTypesFromSpec`](../parsers/registration.lua) — whose dispatch
is already a closed set of constraint kinds (`min/max` → `restrictNumber`,
`minLen/maxLen/pattern` → `restrictString`, `values` → `restrictEnum`, `validate` →
`restrictWithExpression`, `members` → tag). `shape` is a **sixth kind**, and follows
the existing one-constraint-kind-per-type rule. Both declaration paths (a manifest
`custom_types` entry and a `custom_type_def` file) go through that one function, so
both light up at once.

To compose a shape with a further check, declare a second type whose `parent` is the
first — which already works — rather than relaxing the exclusivity rule.

### The parser: `restrictWithShape(badVal, parentName, newName, shapeSpec)`

Built on `extendParser` (the parent parser runs first, then ours), in
[parsers/registration.lua](../parsers/registration.lua):

1. **At registration** (once, not per cell): `parseType` the shape to get its parser.
   Validate that the parent `typeSameOrExtends(parent, "string")` — same guard
   `minLen`/`pattern` use — and that the shape really is a table type
   (`not isNeverTable(shape)`), so `shape=integer` is refused with a clear message
   rather than silently doing nothing.
2. **Per cell**: the parent (string) parser yields the raw text. Trial-parse that text
   with the shape parser against the shared silent `nullBadVal`, saving and restoring
   its error count — the idiom the **union parser** already uses
   ([parsers/generators.lua](../parsers/generators.lua), `get_union_parser`), so a
   failed trial does not pollute the real error count.
3. On failure: one error on the real `badVal` — `does not match shape
   {integer,integer}` — not the shape parser's inner complaints.
4. On success: return the shape parser's **reformatted** text as both the parsed value
   and the reformatted value. That text is the brace-less canonical form
   (`serializeTableWithoutCB`), which is exactly the cell convention.

`extendParser` already registers the `extends string` relation and inherits the string
comparator, so schema export, SQL typing, sorting and the `NEVER_TABLE` bookkeeping all
follow for free.

### What we deliberately do NOT do

- Not a new *kind* of value. The parsed value is a `string`, full stop. Nothing
  downstream learns a new type, which is why the blast radius is small.
- Not `FORCE_REFORMATTED_AS_STRING`. That flag is for the *opposite* case (a non-string
  parsed value that reformats as a string, e.g. `cmp_version`). A shaped value is
  already a string, so `quoteIfNeeded` does the right thing, and `serializeTable`
  quotes a non-identifier string key by itself — which is what makes `["1,2"]=v`
  round-trip through `ltcn`'s `Key = Number + String + Boolean`.

## Phases

### Phase 1 — the type ✅ **done** (registration + parser + canonicalization)

`shape` field (`custom_type_def`, the manifest tuple form, `builtin_wiring`'s field
list), `restrictWithShape`, dispatch branch, registration-time guards, and the
shape's own strict completeness check. Specs in `spec/parsers_shaped_types_spec.lua`,
plus regressions for the three bugs above in the tuple / map / custom-type specs.

One thing worth knowing: a shaped type validates *strictly* — missing elements and
fields are rejected — while the containers it delegates to do **not**. That is
deliberate (see Decisions), not an inconsistency to "fix" by loosening the shape.

### Phase 2 — reaching the table from an expression (the one open phase)

A shaped value is a **string in canonical form**, so an `=expr` cell, a validator or a
pre-processor that wants its *parts* needs to parse that string. The first draft of this
phase tied the helper to "the column's declared shape" — but that only serves the case
where the shaped type is the key of a top-level map. A shaped type can sit **anywhere**
in a column's type: an element of a `{Coord}` array, a value in a nested
`{name:{Coord:string}}`, a record field. A column-shape-aware helper is blind to all of
those, and too narrow to be worth building.

The right primitive is **value-level and column-agnostic**:

```lua
parseAs(value, typeSpec)   -- parseAs("1,2", "{integer,integer}") -> {1, 2}
```

It takes the string and the type to read it as, and returns the parsed Lua value (or nil
on mismatch). It never inspects the column, so it works wherever the string sits, at any
depth. Note the subtlety: you parse as the **shape** (`{integer,integer}`), not the
shaped type *name* (`Coord`), since `Coord` is a string type and would just hand the
string back. A `shapeOf("Coord") -> "{integer,integer}"` lookup (from `SHAPE_TYPES`) is
optional sugar on top.

This is **not shaped-types-specific** — it is "interpret cell text as a type" for
expressions, of which reading a shaped value's parts is one use. That breadth is the
argument for building it as a clean general primitive; the argument against is the usual
one for `sandboxHelpers` (permanent expression-surface API, best shaped by a real
consumer), so it stays deferred. Implementation is small: resolve `typeSpec` to a parser
via `parsers.parseType`, run it against a throwaway `badVal` with the sandbox quota,
return the parsed value or nil — the same re-run-the-parser move the natural-JSON import
path already makes. Until it exists, a shaped value is fully usable as a **key** and as
**opaque canonical text** (the headline uses); only computing on its parts inside an
expression waits.

### Phase 3 — the payoff, as tests ✅ **done**

`spec/shaped_types_round_trip_spec.lua`, two layers: value-level serialize→deserialize
for native / typed JSON / natural JSON / XML (+ SQL embedding), and a full
`manifest_loader` → `reformatter` → reload cycle on a `{Coord:string}` column. Proves
the string key survives every format, that a non-canonical key is rewritten canonical in
the file, and that reload is clean and reformat-stable. Findings folded into Status:
the idempotency fix (bug 4) and the documented natural-JSON coercion edge. One testing
gotcha worth knowing: a loaded cell is a **read-only proxy**, reachable by key but not
by `next`/`pairs`, so key-type assertions must `unwrap` first.

### Phase 4 — docs ✅ **done**

`DATA_FORMAT_README.md` — new "Shaped String Types" section, the `shape` row in the
custom-type field table, the sixth constraint kind, and a *"what to do instead"* pointer
from "Tables Are Not Valid Map Keys", which until now only said *don't*. CHANGELOG has
the feature under Added and the three bugs (plus the duplicate-key change) under Fixed.

## Decisions

- **Canonicalize on load** (2026-07-14, user). Not optional: it is what gives a shaped
  key value-semantics. The reformatter will therefore rewrite `1, 2` as `1,2` in the
  author's file, exactly as it already does for every other container cell.
- **Fix the tuple *crash*, not the tuple *laxness*** (2026-07-14, user). A cell with too
  many elements is now a reported error rather than a crash, but a cell with too *few*
  is still silently accepted, in tuples and records alike. Shaped types therefore check
  their own completeness instead of relying on the container. The lax-arity hole remains
  open — it affects every tuple and record column, and deserves its own decision, since
  closing it would turn data that "passed" for years into errors.
- **A key collision is an error** (2026-07-14, forced by a test). See Status.
- **Identical re-registration is a no-op** (2026-07-14, forced by a Phase 3 test). Bug 4
  in Status: shaped types now match every other custom-type kind, which already tolerated
  it.

## Open questions

1. **Field name.** `shape` is the working name. Alternatives considered: `represents`,
   `encodes`, `structure`, `parses_as`. `shape` is short and reads well in a TSV.
2. **Ordering is lexicographic**, inherited from the string comparator — so `"10,2"`
   sorts before `"9,1"`. Deterministic and stable, but it will surprise someone who
   writes a `Coord` and expects numeric order. Documented as such for now; an opt-in
   shape-aware comparator stays possible, but one that parses every cell on every
   comparison is a bad trade.
3. **Should the shape be exported in the schema** (`parsers/schema_export.lua`)? It is
   real, checkable structure that a consumer of the schema would want. Cheap to add,
   but it is the one place the shape leaks outside the type system. Still open.
4. **Empty / degenerate shapes** — `shape={}` is currently *accepted* (`{}` is a table
   type, so the guard passes), giving a type whose only legal value is the empty
   string. Harmless, but almost certainly a typo when written. Refuse it? Still open.
5. **The error message names the internal parser, not the type.** A pattern- or
   length-restricted type reports as `string._RS_R_ANY_RE__0x5E...` rather than `Sku`,
   because `restrictString` pushes the *generated* name onto the col_types stack. This
   predates shapes (it is how every `restrictString` type has always reported) and is
   ugly enough to be worth its own small fix. Shaped types are unaffected — they report
   as `Coord`, because `restrictWithShape` registers under the declared name.
