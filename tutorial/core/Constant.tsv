# ^ This file publishes game constants via publishContext=Constant, publishColumn=value.
# ^ That means other files with higher loadOrder can reference these by name in expressions.
# ^ For example, a cell in Creature.tsv can use =baseDamage because baseDamage is published here.
baseDamage	Base Damage	10.0	points	Baseline damage used for scaling all combat calculations
critMultiplier	Crit Multiplier	2.5	multiplier	Critical hit damage multiplier applied on critical strikes
maxLevel	Max Level	99.0	level	Maximum character level in the game
goldPerLevel	Gold Per Level	50.0	gold	Gold reward granted per level gained
# Expression rows: the value cell starts with = to indicate an expression
scaledDamage	Scaled Damage	=baseDamage*critMultiplier	points	Computed: baseDamage * critMultiplier
# Library function usage: gameLib is registered in Manifest.transposed.tsv
circleArea	Circle Area	=gameLib.circleArea(10)	squareMetre	Using gameLib.circleArea() library function
lerpValue	Lerp Value	=gameLib.lerp(0, baseDamage, 0.75)	points	Linear interpolation from 0 to baseDamage at 75%
clampedValue	Clamped Value	=gameLib.clamp(250, 0, goldPerLevel*maxLevel)	gold	Clamped to range [0, goldPerLevel*maxLevel]
