# ^ This file uses the same column structure as core Item.tsv, demonstrating CROSS-PACKAGE references:
# ^ itemCode, gold: custom types defined in core Manifest, available here because of the dependency
# ^ Rarity: enum defined in core Rarity.tsv, registered via superType=enum
# ^ advancedElement: restricted enum from expansion Manifest (subset of core Element: Shadow, Light, Fire)
# ^ CurrencyType: type tag defined in core, extended in expansion with bossGem (cross-package merge)
# ^ This shows how expansion mods can reuse core types while adding their own restrictions.
