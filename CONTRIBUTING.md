# Contributing to TabuLua

Hello, and thank you for considering a contribution.

This is a personal, "scratch my itch" project, and I don't expect any kind of contribution.

With that being said, if you use this project, please consider adding a link to this repository in your credits.

Also, if you encounter a bug, consider creating an issue on Github for it. And if you have implemented a fix or a new feature, which you think would be "generally useful", feel free to submit a pull request.

Thanks again, and happy coding!
